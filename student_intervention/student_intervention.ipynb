Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below â€” 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "The predictive performance of SVMs is slightly better than Naive Bayes. However, it is important to note how SVMs' computational time would grow much faster than Naive Bayes with more data, and our costs would increase exponentially when we have more students. On the other hand, Naive Bayes' computational time would grow linearly with more data, and our cost would not rise as fast. Hence, Naive Bayes offers a good alternative to SVMs taking into account its performance on a small dataset and on a potentially large and growing dataset. \n",

Although the results show Logistic Regression is slightly worst than Naive Bayes in terms of it predictive performance, slight tuning of Logistic Regression's model would easily yield much better predictive performance compare to Naive Bayes. This is in contrast to Naive Bayes where we do not have the opportunity to tune model. Hence, we should go with Logistic Regression."

    "First, the model learns how a student's performance indicators lead to whether a student will graduate or otherwise. The model can do this because we already have existing data on students who have and have not graduated, so our model can learn the performance indicators of those students. Based on the student's performance indicators, the model would output a weight for each performance indicator. \n",

This time we do not have information on existing students whether they have graduated or not as they are still studying. However, we have a model that learned from previous batches of students who graduated. The new students' performance indicators with their respective weights will be fed into our model and the model will output a probability and students will be classified according to whether they are \"likely to graduate\" or \"unlikely to graduate\". We can then take preventive measures on students who are unlikely to graduate. \n",

    "Moreover, if we would like to play it safe and ensure that we spot as many students as we can who are \"unlikely to graduate\", even if they may be \"likely to graduate\", we can increase our strictness in determining their likelihood of graduating, and spot more of them. This is because there is no harm in flagging a student who is \"likely to graduate\" as \"unlikely to graduate\". But there may be severe repercussions if we flag a student who is \"unlikely to graduate\" as \"likely to graduate\" and do not attend to the student."
